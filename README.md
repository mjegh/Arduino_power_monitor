Arduino_power_monitor

A project to monitor the electricity used at my house. Includes the code for
the arduino and a schematic of the additional circuitry.

My first blog post was "Monitoring my house power with an Arduino and Perl" at http://www.martin-evans.me.uk/node/86. There are additions "New data shield" at http://martin-evans.me.uk/node/88 and then my final version "Version 2 electricty meter power logging" at http://martin-evans.me.uk/node/94.
